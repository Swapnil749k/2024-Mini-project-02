Project Title: Third-Party User Login Integration

Description:
This mini-project demonstrates the integration of third-party login functionality into a web application. The primary goal is to enable users to log in using their existing accounts from popular third-party services like Google, Facebook, or GitHub, rather than creating a new account specifically for the application.

Features:
Third-Party Authentication: Users can sign in using their existing accounts from Google, Facebook, or GitHub.
User Data Retrieval: Upon successful authentication, basic user profile information is retrieved from the third-party service and stored in the application's database.
Session Management: Users remain logged in across different sessions until they explicitly log out or their session expires.
Security Measures: Implementation of security best practices, such as using OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication, to ensure secure user authentication and data protection.
User Interface: A clean and intuitive user interface for the login page, providing seamless integration with the third-party login options.

Additional Notes:
This mini-project serves as a starting point for implementing third-party login functionality in larger-scale applications.
It's essential to review and comply with the terms of service and usage policies of the third-party services being integrated.
Regularly update dependencies and review security measures to address potential vulnerabilities.
